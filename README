This directory contains a set of perl libraries written and copyrighted
by A.M. Thurnherr. The software is written in perl (V5.8.8 or later
should work) and assumed to run in a UN*X environment.

To find out which version you have, run "make" in current directory.

Most of the source files use a hard tab of 4 spaces, i.e. they can be
viewed correctly, e.g. with "less -x4".

There is currently no documentation, nor is there support.

SOFTWARE CAN BE FREELY USED AND COPIED FOR EDUCATIONAL OR OTHER
NOT-FOR-PROFIT PURPOSES.
